Sierra Leone
I reached out to the family friend who got me involved with SFH and asked if i volunteer in anyway. He mentioned I could shadow him and attempt to audit the data team. So i made the trip and tried my best to help out. I spoke with members of the team, participated in meetings, and travelled with them to the various locations. At the end, I wrote suggestions creating a public archive with the data so it may be used for other purposes, using more efficient tools as the amount of data increased and it became harder to store or organize, stuff similar to that. It was a great learning experience and a beautiful city. 

Haiti
Since I entered into CS, i was looking into ways to volunteer and get experience. I had a family friend who was involved with SFH at Udel and she got me in contact with the director. I was able to do some work on their site creating pages and maintaining the site and its users with Wordpress HTML and CSS. Then I was able to visit Haiti with them in 2015 and participate in their seminars on womens health and family stability. 

UPS
This was my first technical internship at a company and it was great bc I got to really see how CS was applied in the real world. I was on an R&D team which meant i was exposed to a lot of new and upcoming technolgies which was great, but the teams focus was to decide the tech UPS should adopt. Which meant I wasnt doing as much coding as I would have liked.
